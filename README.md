# UPI-ID-QR-Code-Generator-Python-
Developed a tool to generate dynamic QR codes for UPI (Unified Payments Interface) IDs using Python. This project leverages libraries like qrcode to generate scannable QR codes that facilitate quick UPI payments. Implemented a simple GUI with Tkinter for user interaction, allowing input of UPI IDs and generating corresponding QR codes for easy payments.
